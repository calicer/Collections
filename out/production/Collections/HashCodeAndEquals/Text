== Equality...
for primitives it works fine..as it checks if they are pointing to the same memory location
Equality with objects
Two objects with two different references so they are unequal....
but two objects with two different references but same data in member variables....???
Java says they aren't equal...

so we have a hook equals() method from object method
Can be overridden


----Hashing----
process of taking object and reducing in one value...hashCode
hash code should be same...always if u run hashcode method any number of times
hash collision  -- same hash code of two different objects

hashCode is a method in java
